# Github_Combinatorics_Optimization_Project


Discrete or combinatorial optimization embodies a vast and significant area of combinatorics that interfaces many related subjects. 
Included among these are linear programming, operations research, theory of algorithms and computational complexity.

Much of combinatorial optimization is motivated by very simple and natural problems 
   such as routing problems in networks, packing and covering problems in graph theory, scheduling problems, and sorting problems. 
But the methodology of the subject encompasses a variety of techniques ranging from 
    elementary tree-growing procedures to constructions of Hilbert bases of integer lattices.
