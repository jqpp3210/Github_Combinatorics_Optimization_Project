# Github_Combinatorics_Optimization_Project


Discrete or combinatorial optimization embodies a vast and significant area of combinatorics that interfaces many related subjects. 
Included among these are linear programming, operations research, theory of algorithms and computational complexity.

Much of combinatorial optimization is motivated by very simple and natural problems such as routing problems in networks, packing and covering problems in graph theory, scheduling problems, and sorting problems. 
But the methodology of the subject encompasses a variety of techniques ranging from elementary tree-growing procedures to constructions of Hilbert bases of integer lattices.

AFSO (artificial fish-swarm optimization) is one of the best methods of optimization among the swarm intelligence algorithms. 
This algorithm is inspired by the collective movement of the fish and their various social behaviors. 
Based on a series of instinctive behaviors, the fish always try to maintain their colonies and accordingly demonstrate intelligent behaviors. 
Searching for food, immigration and dealing with dangers all happen in a social form and interactions between all fish in a group will result in an intelligent social behavior.
This algorithm has many advantages including high convergence speed, flexibility, fault tolerance and high accuracy.
